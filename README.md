This project uses object-oriented programming to simulate an intersection controlled by traffic lights. In the program, 
cars signal when they want to cross, and the lights change between green, yellow, and red as appropriate. The program 
takes into account traffic light rules so cars do not crash, including paired behavior and delay time for light changes. 
A global clock keeps track of the time.

This project was completed as part of the MSc Computing at Imperial College London.
